This project focuses on machine learning techniques for stroke prediction using 1) cluster degmentation health profile analysis, 2) logistic regression for prediction stroke incidence, based on cluster profiles. 

It involves analyzing a dataset containing demographics and health-related data to identify patterns and associations. The project is divided into several parts, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, clustering using K-Means and PCA, validation and subsequent logistic regression. The project is systematically outlined in a project report. 

Methodological Overview:
- Subset creation. Missing values removal. Variable pre-processing. 
- Descriptives and initial Visualizations. 
- K-Means clustering for grouping similar individuals.
- PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Visualization and validation techniques.
- Logistic Regression for predicting stroke.
- Model evaluations.

The project was entirely coded using google colab.
